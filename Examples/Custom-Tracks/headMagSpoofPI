 * MagSpoof - "wireless" magnetic stripe/credit card emulator
 *
 * by Samy Kamkar
 *
 * http://samy.pl/magspoof/
 *
 * - Allows you to store all of your credit cards and magstripes in one device
 * - Works on traditional magstripe readers wirelessly (no NFC/RFID required)
 * - Can disable Chip-and-PIN (code not included)
 * - Correctly predicts Amex credit card numbers + expirations from previous card number (code not included)
 * - Supports all three magnetic stripe tracks, and even supports Track 1+2 simultaneously
 * - Easy to build using Arduino or ATtiny
 *
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * MagSpoofPI - code integration by Salvador Mendoza
 *
 * Main idea: be able to compile MagSpoof with variable tracks, and use MagSpoof
 * without arduino dependency, and without removing it from the raspberry pi gpio.
 * -
 * Special code for Raspberry Pi implementing avr-gcc without arduino.
 * -
 * Main modifications from the original MagSpoof in functions like digitalWrite(), 
 * setup() and loop().
 *
 * Example of configuration:
 * rbpi     attiny85
 *  19  -->  PB0
 *  21  -->  PB1
 *  23  -->  PB2
 * DC17  --> VCC
 * GND20 ->  GND
 * RST15 ->  PB5
